# Soccer-League
A soccer league management system where the league is composed by teams, players and managers. 
The language for this project is Java and the IDE that I have worked on was Eclipse.
The main goals for this project were learning how to use JavaFX for the GUI, implementing JPA instead of JDBC (which I had used in another project),
writing a neat Java Documentation, using an MVC architecture with an appropriate package
structure and doing some JUnit tests. All the data was stored using an SQLITE database.
